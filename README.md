The JSON files used are edited versions of the ones from fellow GitHub user BTMorton, available <a href="https://github.com/BTMorton/dnd-5e-srd/tree/master/json">here</a>. These JSON files contain the core rules from the SRD. Note that my JSON files have edited their work, and includes some formatting differences as well as a few additional spells not in the 5.0 version of the SRD, but they are in the 5.1 version of the SRD.
